# Predicting bulldozer price using sklearn
This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting the price of a bulldozer.

We're going to take the following approach:

1. Problem definition
2. Data
3. Evaluation
4. Features
5. Modelling
